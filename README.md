# Undergraduate-Project
Athletes who perform gymnastics face several
issues like registering for an event, documents verification,
event schedule, etc. With such a mess to just register for an
event, It even becomes difficult for the athletes to know their
ranking and performance.
The gymnastic event management system enables athletes to
register for an event, upload documents and details online. The
inbuilt algorithms will generate a schedule and inform the
users for the same, this will help athletes to easily keep track of
their upcoming events. Based on their performance judges will
rank them and results will be generated in real time and the
same will be updated on website/app, basically a real time
scoreboard will be shown on system.
This system will thus help athletes to keep tracks of their
events and performance, it will also reduce the overhead for
the organizers to manually schedule the events, verify
documents and update scoreboards. 
Technologies Used: MongoDB, Express.js, Angular, Node.js, Visual Studio Code.
